# Rezi Sabashvili ‚Äì Data & Economic Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio. I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Economic Policy and Statistical Evaluation at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne. This space showcases a curated selection of academic projects in data analysis, statistical modeling, forecasting, and data visualization.

My academic journey combines economic insight with technical proficiency, and I am particularly interested in applying data-driven solutions in the **banking and financial sectors**, with the goal of pursuing a career in the **United States**.
