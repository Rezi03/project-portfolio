## How to navigate

- Start with the `final_submission` folder to see the final thesis document, presentation, and scoring sheet.
- Check the `docs` folder for supporting articles and ethics submission documentation.
- The `data` folder contains the anonymized datasets used for analysis.
- The `digital_traces` folder holds datasets created for hypothesis testing and the Python notebook for analysis.
- The main analyses are in the `analyses` folder, organized by themes (descriptive, anonymization, path analysis, indicators, clustering, and page title analysis).
